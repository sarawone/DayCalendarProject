# ðŸ“… Special Days Calendar Generator

This project generates a calendar that includes special commemorative days (like Ada Lovelace Day, Red Panda Day, etc.) based on rules from a `days.json` file.

You can also export these dates to `.ics` format for use in calendar apps like Google Calendar or Outlook.

----------------

### âœ… 1. Install Node.js

Ensure you're using Node.js version 20 or higher (for native `.json` module imports):

```bash
node -v

npm install

This will install:

Jest â€“ test runner

Babel â€“ allows using import/export syntax with Jest

babel-jest â€“ bridge between Jest and Babel

npm test

This runs all test files matching *.test.js

You can also run: 
npx jest
